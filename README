Frr_gns3 is a smaller linux image for GNS3[0] to provide a FRR[1] router using the FRR project.

It's built using Kiwi, a tool to build system images. All the needed files are included in this repo.
It uses the OpenSuse Leap 15.2 JEOS kiwi configuration, obviously slightly modified, to keep the image small.

When built it should be about 350MB. If did have it down to 250MB but in order to add the MPLS drivers, which
weren't included in the jeos cut down kernel, meant I needed to install the full blown suse kernel.
